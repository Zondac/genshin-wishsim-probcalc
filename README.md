Uses the same probabilities as https://github.com/AguzzTN54/Genshin-Impact-Wish-Simulator
I just made this because I wanted to plan out some future rolls and getting some probabilities of combined rolls without having to do the math. 

I could also make a mathematically correct calculator but I'm gonna be honest, where's the fun in that! Someone would have to request that for me to bother...
